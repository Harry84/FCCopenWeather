FCC Open Weather app by Samatar, Harry and E

In order to save on API calls I have commented out the promise chain ( line 33 - 56 ) and replaced jsonObject with my own custom weather object (the weather for where I live). Feel free to change this custom object as you wish!!
(this will break the functionality of the change-units button, since the units are applied in the API call, but it is working don't worry!)
